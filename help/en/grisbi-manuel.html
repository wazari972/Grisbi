First of all, have you subscribed to Grisbi's 
<A HREF="mailto:infos@grisbi.org">infos mailing list</A>?<BR>
<BR>
You will receive only a few messages a year, about 
the new versions and the bugs fixes.<BR>
<BR>
So don't wait, do it just now!<BR>
<BR>

Since the 0.4.1 version, the user guide is no more integrated in the package of Grisbi.
Effectively, its ever-growing weight and its internationalisation obliged us to create
a separate package.

<h1>The Guide Types</h1>

The user guide comes in two types:

<ul>

	<li>a text only type;</li>
	
	<li>an illustrated type, with many screenshots.</li>

</ul>

It is obvious that the second one is more pleasant to use but take also
longer to download. So it's up to you...

<H1>Installing the Guide</H1>

On <a href="http://www.grisbi.org">Grisbi's site</A> you'll find the package you need in the section
<A href="http://www.grisbi.org/download.en.html#doc">Documentation</A> from the
<A href="http://www.grisbi.org/download.en.html">Download</A> page.
For the moment only the French version is available.

Translators welcome! Send a mail to 
<a href="mailto:daniel@grisbi.org?Subject='[grisbi] Translation'&Body='I
can translate the users guide in the following language:'">Daniel</a>
if you want to help Grisbi.

<H2>Installing a Package</H2>

Like the program, the guide is available as Debian or RPM packages.
However there are no specifics packages for other distributions.

Install the package as you use to. The files will be placed in the
/usr/share/gnome/help/grisbi/C directory.

<H2>Installing Manually</H2>

If for any reason you need (or prefer) to process the installation
manually, you must download the manuel-grisbi-xxx-n.n.n.tar.gz archive,
where xxx is the version type (text or illustrated, txt or img respectively)
and n.n.n the version number.

Untar this archive and copy all the  .html and .png files as well as the
topic.dat file in the /usr/share/gnome/help/grisbi/C directory.
