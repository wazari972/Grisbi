First of all, have you subscribed to Grisbi's 
<A HREF="mailto:infos@grisbi.org">infos mailing list</A>?<BR>
<BR>
You will receive only a few messages a year, about 
the new versions and the bugs fixes.<BR>
<BR>
So don't wait, do it just now!<BR>
<BR>

<H1>Chapter&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;Create an Account File</H1>

<H2>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Import QIF files</H2>

We'll suppose you have exported your accounts as QIF files 
with your former accounting program (you need a QIF file for
 each account). Now you can import them in Grisbi:
<UL><LI>click on the menu <I><FONT COLOR=maroon>File/Import/QIF file</FONT></I>;<BR>
<BR>
<LI>select the directory containing the QIF files;<BR>
<BR>
<LI>select them all by clicking on their name. Grisbi must
 import them at once in order to reconstitute the links beetween 
the accounts (notably transfers). Then valid.
As Grisbi asks you to confirm, you still can add an account if you forgot one;<BR>
<BR>
<LI>choose the currency of each account. The default choice is 
Euro but you can create a new currency by clicking the 
<I><FONT COLOR=maroon>New currency</FONT></I> button.</UL>
Grisbi will process your files for a few seconds, and that will be it.<BR>
<BR>

<H2>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;New Account File</H2>

You don't have any file to import. Click on the menu <I><FONT COLOR=maroon>File/New</FONT></I> 
to create a new accounts file, then on
<I><FONT COLOR=maroon>Account/New</FONT></I> to create the accounts you need.<BR>
<BR>
Now click on the tab <I><FONT COLOR=maroon>Transactions</FONT></I>, then on the left icon 
 <I><FONT COLOR=maroon>Show/mask the form</FONT></I>.<BR>
<BR>
You are ready to enter your transactions.<BR>
<BR>

<H1>Chapter&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;Grisbi's Tabs</H1>

<H2>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Home</H2>

Displays your accounts list, their balance, and the warnings.<BR>
<BR>

<H2>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Transactions</H2>

Displays in the right part the transactions of the account you selected in the left part.
Allows you to enter transactions. For this you must first click on the left icon
of the tool bar, or double-click in the first empty line of the transactions list.<BR>
<BR>
The transactions can be displayed with more or less information. Use the icons
with white and blue lines to change the number of information lines displayed.
You can also choose to display or not the reconciliated transactions by clicking on the
R or crossed R icons.<BR>
<BR>
For creating a third part that doesn't exist in your file, just enter
its name in the combo box, and it will be added.<BR>
<BR>
For creating a new category or budgetary-line, do the same but be careful with the syntax: you
must separate the name of the category and the one of the sub-category with:
<UL><LI>a space;<BR>
<BR>
<LI>a colon (:);<BR>
<BR>
<LI>another space,</UL>
or else Grisbi will not understand.<BR>
<BR>
For creating a new financial year click on the menu
<I><FONT COLOR=maroon>Setup/Financial years</FONT></I>.<BR>
<BR>

<H2>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Scheduler</H2>

Allows you to schedule repetitive transactions.<BR>
<BR>

<H2>2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounts</H2>

Displays the list of all your accounts and their properties, and
allows you to edit them.<BR>
<BR>

<H2>2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Third parts</H2>

Displays the list of all the third-parts, the complementary information
about them, and allow you to edit them.
Also displays the transactions sorted by account (you can use the icons for
quickly opening or closing the tree).
Allows you to access a given transaction immediately by double-clicking
on it.<BR>
<BR>

<H2>2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;Categories</H2>

The same as the <I><FONT COLOR=maroon>Third parts</FONT></I> tab, it allows you to classify
your incomes and outgoings.
You can add or edit a category or sub-category, and display the transactions
of one or all categories.<BR>
<BR>

<H2>2.7&nbsp;&nbsp;Budgetary lines</H2>

The same as the former ones, it allows you to manage your budgetary lines.<BR>
<BR>

<H2>2.8&nbsp;&nbsp;Reports</H2>

Allows you to create and display all the reports you need.
Some are already built-in, and you can customize them with a very powerful tool.<BR>
<BR>
For the moment you can't print them (this is planned for the 0.4.3 version).<BR>
<BR>

<H1>Chapter&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;Grisbi's menus</H1>

The <I><FONT COLOR=maroon>File</FONT></I> and <I><FONT COLOR=maroon>Accounts</FONT></I> menus are
quite intuitive. The <I><FONT COLOR=maroon>Setup</FONT></I> menu allows you to setup Grisbi's 
general behaviour, and is explicit.<BR>
